# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing leetcode questions.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Kth smallest element in a BST problem at first, but all others problems were easy to medium difficulty. Tomorrow i might go for harder questions.

**Link to work:** [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)
**Link to work:** [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
**Link to work:** [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)
